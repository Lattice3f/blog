### What is a Voxel-Based Game?

A [voxel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel) is, for our purposes, a cube-shaped part of a 3D volume. Voxel-based games are games where the world is made of up voxelsâ€”essentially, the world is diced up into cubes and each cube can be solid or air and have any number of game-specific pieces of information attatched to it. Typically each cube has a material, such as stone or dirt, that affects how it looks and how players interact with it. Voxel-based games are usually targeted toward gamers who like to flex their creativity as they allow for worlds that are completely rearrangable.

The most prominent example of a voxel-based game is [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/en-us/), but others exist such as [Stellar Overload](http://www.stellar-overload.com/) and [Lemma](http://lemmagame.com/). There's a rich indie community around voxel game dev too; in particular, [the voxel game dev subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoxelGameDev/) is quite active and has some good content.
