### What is a Voxel-Based Game?

A [voxel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel) is, for game dev purposes, a cube-shaped part of a 3D volume. Voxel-based games are games where the world is made of up voxelsâ€”essentially, the world is diced up into cubes and each cube can be solid or air and have any number of game-specific pieces of information attatched to it. Typically each cube has a material, such as stone or dirt, that affects how it looks and how players interact with it.

In most games the world is statically arranged. The developers model the world, compile it into the game, and potentially add a few interactive elements. Voxel-based games allow for worlds that players can completely rearrange by manipulating the assignments of materials and other data to the voxels in the world; voxel-based games are especially good for this because these manipulations are easy for players to reason about and easy for computers to process. Because of this, voxel-based games are usually targeted toward gamers who like to flex their creativity.

The most prominent example of a voxel-based game is [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/en-us/), but others exist such as [Stellar Overload](http://www.stellar-overload.com/) and [Lemma](http://lemmagame.com/). There's a rich indie community around voxel game dev too; in particular, [the voxel game dev subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoxelGameDev/) is quite active and has some good content.
