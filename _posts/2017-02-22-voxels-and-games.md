### What is a Voxel-Based Game?

A [voxel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel) is, for game dev purposes, a cube-shaped part of a 3D volume. Voxel-based games are games where the world is made of up voxelsâ€”essentially, the world is diced up into cubes and each cube can be solid or air and have any number of game-specific pieces of information attatched to it. Typically each voxel has a material, such as stone or dirt, that affects how it looks and how players interact with it.

In most games the world is statically arranged. The developers model the world, compile it into the game, and potentially add a few interactive elements. Voxel-based games allow for worlds that players can completely rearrange by manipulating the assignments of materials and other data to the voxels in the world; voxel-based games are especially good for this because these manipulations are easy for players to reason about and easy for computers to process. Because of this, voxel-based games are usually targeted toward gamers who like to flex their creativity.

The most prominent example of a voxel-based game is [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/en-us/), but others exist such as [Stellar Overload](http://www.stellar-overload.com/) and [Lemma](http://lemmagame.com/). There's a rich indie community around voxel game dev too; in particular, [the voxel game dev subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/VoxelGameDev/) is quite active and has some good content.

### Typical Qualities of Voxel-Based Games

Because of the prominence of a select few voxel-based games, it's easy to overindex on them when defining what a voxel-based game is. Let's go over some things that a voxel-based game _typically_ is but not necessarily.

#### [A sandbox/open world game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_world)
Just because the world is cubes doesn't mean it isn't focused on a story or mission. A voxel-based game isn't usually the best way to tell a story so a story-centric game is more likely to be made in a different genre. Voxel-based games that have stories often don't center the gameplay on them because much of the value of making a game voxel-based is the freedom that it gives the players to do whatever they want.

#### [A procedurally-generated game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation)
Just because the world is cubes doesn't mean a person didn't carefully arrange those cubes when making the game instead of having the computer generate it. That being said, procedural world generation makes every play of the game unique and is part of what makes the genre uniquely enjoyable.
